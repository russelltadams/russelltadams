## Avast Software
### IT Manager, North America

I am currently managing a team of talented infrastructure and DevOps engineers supporting production workloads in both public and on-premises cloud infrastructure. Our main responsibility is providing a self-service platform via Openstack that is consumed by Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) and Software Engineers/Developers as a foundation for the US mobile carrier applications. The most challenging aspect is maintaining strict mobile carrier-grade security and uptime SLA requirements.  We meet these requirements not only by creating a robust Openstack infrastructure based on Redhat's TripleO community best practices, but also by maintaining transparent workflows that allow for efficient change control and change management.
