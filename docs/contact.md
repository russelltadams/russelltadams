## E-mail

E-mail is broken tech debt the whole world is still trying to recover from, but probably never will. Sadly it still has a role to play in workplace and business to business communications. Thankfully it is quickly and frequently, not always successfully, being relegated to only the use cases that it is really good for, and is quickly be supplemented by much better forms of communication. Since reaching out to a random person you don't know yet is the perfect use case for email, please feel free to email me, and good luck! Can you read JavaScript? It's not that hard.   

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
<!-- Begin
user = "russell.t.adams";
domain = "gmail.com";
document.write('E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + domain + '\">' +
			user + '@' + domain + '</a>');
// End -->
</script>

## Keybase

Keybase is a key directory that maps identities to encryption keys in a publicly auditable manner. Unlike email, it allows auditable proof of sender and receiver identities and as an added bonus we may choose to keep these communications encrypted. This of course requires you to participate and form a trust relationship with me on Keybase.io. Since Keybase handles the heavy lifting but maintains end-to-end encryption where your private keys only exist on your devices, its both easy, and secure. A hard combo to achieve.
